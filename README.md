# UAH RWA

This project is implementation of the Stablecoin directly pegged to UAH. We gonna use two possible collaterals:

1. The real UAH stored on the MonoBank account
2. The limited set of the ERC20 tokens (stable-coins preferred) 

For receiving the amount of money stored on the MonoBank account and for receiving the actual rate of the UAH to corresponding ERC20 we are using Chainlink Functions.
